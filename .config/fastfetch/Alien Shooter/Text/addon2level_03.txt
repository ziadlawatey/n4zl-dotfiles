MISSION 03:
training complex

DESCRIPTION:
Hope dies last...
You can still smell the sweat of 
fighters training in these gyms. 
Maybe there are some living 
humans here? What if the monsters 
haven't reached this area yet?.. 
After all the massacres and 
hardship, your soul still keeps 
some bits of humaneness and hope.  

OBJECTIVE:
Walk through the training complex, 
eliminate all the monsters.

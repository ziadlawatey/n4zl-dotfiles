MISSION 02:
school laboratory

DESCRIPTION:
They used to study here - all 
these pupils and students, 
with their lessons, exams, 
textbooks, and crib sheets, 
of course. But now it's so quiet 
in the classroms... a kind 
of unnatural silence, fom time 
to time interrupted by 
groans and growls.

OBJECTIVE:
Examine the rooms of the school 
building, try to find survivors, 
destroy every alien you meet.
